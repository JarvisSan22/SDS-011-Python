Description: Adafruit Python DHT Sensor Library
        ==================================
        
        Python library to read the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a
        Raspberry Pi or Beaglebone Black.
        
        Designed specifically to work with the Adafruit DHT series sensors ---->
        https://www.adafruit.com/products/385
        
        Currently the library is tested with Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4. It should
        work with Python greater than 3.4, too.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        For all platforms (Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black) make sure your system is
        able to compile and download Python extensions with **pip**:
        
        On Raspbian or Beaglebone Black's Debian/Ubuntu image you can ensure your
        system is ready by running one or two of the following sets of commands:
        
        Python 2:
        
        ````sh
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python-pip
        sudo python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
        ````
        
        Python 3:
        
        ````sh
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install python3-pip
        sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
        ````
        
        ### Install with pip
        
        Use `pip` to install from PyPI.
        
        Python 2:
        
        ```sh
        sudo pip install Adafruit_DHT
        ```
        
        Python 3:
        
        ```sh
        sudo pip3 install Adafruit_DHT
        ```
        
        ### Compile and install from the repository
        
        First download the library source code from the [GitHub releases
        page](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT/releases), unzipping the
        archive, and execute:
        
        Python 2:
        
        ```sh
        cd Adafruit_Python_DHT
        sudo python setup.py install
        ```
        
        Python 3:
        
        ```sh
        cd Adafruit_Python_DHT
        sudo python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        You may also git clone the repository if you want to test an unreleased
        version:
        
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git
        ```
